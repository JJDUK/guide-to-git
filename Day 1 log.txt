First steps
- Created Public Repository in Github https://github.com/JJDUK/guide-to-git.git
- Opend VS Code on laptop
- Ran following commands

 cd c://git/
 # cd = change directory; c://git/ = location of my git folder on laptop 

 git clone https://github.com/JJDUK/guide-to-git.git
 # git clone clones a repo from the provided URL

 cd guide-to-git
 # change directory to the repo folder

 git switch branch -c begin
 # switch branch to a newly created branch (-c) caled "begin" 
 
 git status
 # check status to confirm changes
 
 git branch
 # lists git branches, and shows which one is there

Then I edited the readme with more information and created this Day 1 log.txt

ctrl s on this file to save

What I will do after saving this log:

commands:
git add README.md
git add "Day 1 log.txt"
# adds these updated and new files. Notes: case sensetive; requires quotes if spaces in file name.

git commit -am "Updated readme and created a log of day 1 activities"
# creates a commit of all (-a) changes and adds a comment (-m) for the commit ""

git push
# pushes the branch to the repository
